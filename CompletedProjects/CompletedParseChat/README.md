Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Had a lot of issues with the segues and storyboard IDs
2. I forgot how to do autolayout on the tableviews, so I struggled for quite a bit.
