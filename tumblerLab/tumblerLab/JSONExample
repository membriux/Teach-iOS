I didn\U2019t know anyone here. \U00a0My English was suck. \U00a0I had my own bedroom in Peru, but here I had to share a room with three people. \U00a0I spent so much time crying. \U00a0I watched a lot of anime. \U00a0Even my cat wouldn\U2019t play with me because she\U2019s not very friendly. \U00a0But finally in March I found a job at a restaurant, and things began to turn around. \U00a0My coworkers became like family. \U00a0My manager Alizee is the most amazing person I\U2019ve ever met. \U00a0And the guys in the kitchen help me with my English. \U00a0There\U2019s a gym nearby, and after work I\U2019ve been taking jiu-jitsu classes. \U00a0It\U2019s helped me a lot. \U00a0There\U2019s one position called guard, and as long as you can keep your guard up, you\U2019ll be alright. \U00a0I feel like I\U2019m finally in control. \U00a0This morning I paid for a whole semester of classes. \U00a0Last year was about surviving. \U00a0But this year I have goals. \U00a0The first one is to get better at jiu-jitsu.&ldquo;<br/></p>";
